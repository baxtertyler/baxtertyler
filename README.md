## About me

**`Software Engineer`**

I'm a computer science student attending the California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo. I hold the belief that technological development can be beneficial for everyone and desire to pursue a career that can have a lasting impact on the world. My abilities revolve around full-stack software engineering and interpersonal communication / relationships, skills I leverage in my professional life. Outside of the tech world I enjoy golfing and surfing.
